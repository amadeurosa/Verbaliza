# Verbaliza
 Display simulator with accessibility application for non-verbal PWDs. The idea behind the app is that the user can click on icons representing actions or emotions. Upon performing this action, a sound corresponding to the image will be triggered. Currently, the application is undergoing some changes, such as the option for the user to add their own sounds and images. At the moment, I have only made available the version in the Portuguese language.
